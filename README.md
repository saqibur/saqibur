<h4>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Saqibur Rahman, a software engineer from <strong>Dhaka, Bangladesh</strong></h4>
  <p>Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience in backend development, software architecture, and team leadership. Proven expertise in Python, Django, and AWS, delivering scalable solutions across travel, healthcare, education, forestry, and energy sectors. Experienced in leading cross-functional teams, mentoring engineers, and driving projects from requirements through to deployment.

Beyond my coding capabilities, I excel in communication, making the intricate details of software development accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders across the board.

One of the highlights of my professional journey has been the opportunity to collaborate with engineers across the globe including Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, Thailand, USA and of course Bangladesh!

Alongside my technical roles, I've been fortunate to take on the role of a mentor. Over the course of my journey, I've had the privilege of guiding and nurturing the growth of more than 20 engineers.</p>
