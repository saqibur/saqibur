<h4>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Saqibur Rahman, a software engineer from <strong>Dhaka, Bangladesh</strong></h4>
  <p>As a senior software engineer with 5+ years in the software development industry, specializing in backend technologies, I've developed a diverse skill set, encompassing roles such as a technical project manager and a technical lead, where I excel in orchestrating cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions.

Over the course of my career, I have successfully managed and launched 10+ impactful projects across education, medical, and travel industries - 3 of which harness LLMs to power generative AI solutions for an enhanced customer experience.

Beyond my coding capabilities, I excel in communication, making the intricate details of software development accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders across the board.

One of the highlights of my professional journey has been the opportunity to collaborate with engineers across the globe including Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, Thailand, USA and of course Bangladesh!

Alongside my technical roles, I've been fortunate to take on the role of a mentor. Over the course of my journey, I've had the privilege of guiding and nurturing the growth of more than 20 engineers.</p>
